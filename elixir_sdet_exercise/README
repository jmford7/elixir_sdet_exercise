*Used Chromedriver v75 - make sure to manually start driver service and leave running prior to running any tests.

*All Testing utilize the same setup: Navigate_to , IO.inspect , Maximize_window. Recommend refactoring to use a single function.
This will simplify testing and make future changes/ additions easier and more reliable.

*Two test blocks are essentially the same code, given different information to create two different errors. 
Recommend use of a page object (or equivalent) to turn code into a single function different varibles can be passed into.

*Screenshots should only be taken during each test block after an :error occurs. Test errors however, no longer print to the console.
To confirm, modify refute -> assert, and vice versa. Screenshots are directed to save in the designated "screenshots" folder.

*Hard coded sleeps to ensure Facebook had enough time to load errors. Was not able to find a 'waitforelement' equivalent
function through an existing library. Recommend removing hard sleeps and replacing with a flexible wait to increase test speed.
